Usage
=====

During the execution of an experiment
-------------------------------------
1.	Open the  ``OMERO_import_template_wMacros_vXX.xlsm`` spreadsheet that was provided to you and fill in the ``Project_Name`` and ``Dataset_Name``fields with unique names that can be used to identify uniquely the Project and the Dataset in OMERO and elsewhere.
2.	``Save as...`` the "OMERO_import_template_wMacros_vXX.xlsm" spreadsheet using your chosen “Project Name” and “Dataset Name” as follows: ``Project-Name_Dataset-Name.xlsm``.
3.	 As you execute the different steps of the procedure, fill in the ``Project-Name_Dataset-Name.xlsm`` spreadsheet you have created above with the indicated metadata values, as explained below.

.. note::

   This will take some time at first. However, things will get much easier going forward, as you can often copy   previously filled-in spreadsheets and only change the relevant metadata values (e.g., Date, Biosample information, Specimen information, Channel Names, etc.). Also, you can often use filled-in spreadsheets from lab mates performing the same experiment type as a starting point.

If you need to change the structure of the spreadsheet template, please ask your Data Curator for help.
